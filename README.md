# **All NeurIPS Papers - LDA Topic Modelling**

##### Topic modelling of ML papers using LDA model in order to improve other methods such us Keyword extraction with TF-IDF method.
My first Kaggle Dataset project on a topic modelling subject. 

This dataset includes 9406 papers on Neural Information Processing Systems (aka. NIPS), inspired by dataset NIPS Papers of Ben Hamner. While the original dataset by Ben Hamner represent the time period of 1987-2017 covering over 7241 papers, 2439 more papers has been published in the year of 2018-19.

The dataset columns are **year of publication**, **title**, **author details**, **abstracts**, and **full text** of each paper.

The main goal is to apply LDA in order to improve the TF-IDF keyword extraction method.
The code results in a set of 20 topics, presenting them visualy with the main keywords for each one.
